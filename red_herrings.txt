Why losing a page is the worst.
Ouch!  Come on.  How does this happen?  You don’t just rip pages out of books!
Alright, well you probably shouldn’t leave without it so what’s your next move.
Get the page you ripped out back. Move to page X.-> Oh sure.  Now you feel a little remorse.  Well it’s too late anyways.  It’s not like you can just paste it or another one back on, right??  Let’s all move on.  Go to page X.  Just don’t do it again. Go back to page X.
Leave to go to the next location without it. ->  I feel a little lighter.  I guess that’s a good thing.  Go to page X.

The terrible truth.
This is after all a time travel device.  What will you do next with this unnatural device?
Go see dinosaurs! -> Woo! Dinosau-…  Wait.  What the?  Awwww…. These scientifically accurate dinosaurs are laaaame.  Actual dinosaurs are pretty dumb looking in comparison to Jurassic Park.  Ah well.  At least you can time travel to some other places. Go back to page X.
Invest in apple early! -> Congrats you and you're team are now the biggest investors in Apple which has earned you all a place on the board of directors!  The future of the company is in your hands…  
-> 25 years later -> You overhear two pedestrians.  “Is that the zunephone 5s?” “Uh no. It’s the 6s.  Everyone has a zunephone 6s.”  Sorry Apple didn’t work out. Go back to page X and try a dfferent one.
-> 50 years later -> You over hear two pedestrians.  “Uh oh. I’m running late and need to call my ride to pick me up.  Can I borrow your phone?”  “Sure, I live close by.  My rotary phone is great.  It’s just like the one my grandparents had in their house.”  “That’s cool.  Thanks.  I love those retro phones.”  “Yea.  I can’t imagine ever having a small brick to weigh me down wherever I go.  To think my parents used to be glued to such small devices.  I wonder whatever happened to those?  I guess old trends, including phones, repeat themselves.” Sorry Apple didn’t work out. Go back to page X and try a different one.
Continue with the puzzle hunting. ->  You and your team made a good choice.  That's what this time travel device is for anyways.  Proceed to page X.

Groan at all the people who still play pokemon go.   ->Uuuuuuuuuggggghhhhhhhhhh.  Eh hem.  Okay.  Let’s keep walking. Turn to page X to go onward.

Red Herring
You’re doing well.  You are scheduled to receive another transfer soon.  It’s recommended that you wait at Location X.
Head over to Location X to receive transfer. -> I love the speed at which you’re pacing.  Won’t be long now till your next assignment.  Don’t give up!  The next one is really cool, although, I think they all have been really cool thus far. Turn to Page X.
Take the rest of the day off. - > You’re so boring.  Too bad for you my recommendation has now turned into a mandatory.  Go back to page X.
