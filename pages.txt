Your feeble attempts at trickery won't work on me. Begone, cheater! Our partnership is over. That goes for all of you! Don't just try to hand me off to one of your meddling friends.

Puzzles with no answers, papercuts on every finger... all this and more awaits you in my land of eternal doom.

PUZZLE TWO: REVISED EDITIONS

So? Now do you understand it? The librarians have been altering history! Changing---or should I say \textit{demolishing}---classic books to better attract the youths of today! This madness must be stopped.

And off we go! You may feel a slight tugging sensation in the area of your left ear, but I assure you that is perfectly normal. 

At this point you may be thinking, ``Hang on, a moment ago we were facing certain death but now we're apparently not dead and the source of our impending doom has seemingly vanished.''

First of all, you're welcome. Second of all, I promise it will all make sense eventually.

Really? Ouch. To be honest, I wasn't expecting you to choose that. I guess I overestimated you lot. As it turns out, you're stuck with me now (and likewise), so I guess we'll just have to work past this sudden betrayal and try to learn to trust each other once more.

But since you insist on not moving out of the way of the cannonfire like any logical being---WATCH OUT!---I suppose I'm going to have to---DUCK!---ugh. Intervene.
