So here we are. Decision time. You can either...

\begin{center}
turn to the next page,

or

turn to the page after that.
\end{center}

\vspace{\fill}

\begin{center}...\end{center}

\textit{what? Did you think this was going to be some fun adventure? You're just reading a book. Now decide before I grow old and all my pages fall out.}

--- Page 2

If you want to go any further down this path, you're going to need to prove to me that you have what it takes.

Turn to the page number matching the number of letters in the answer to Puzzle 1,
Or turn back to page 1.

--- Page 3

Interesting decision! Now, here's another. Excited to see what you do with this one.

To go right, turn to page 5.
To go left, turn to page 6.

(REPLACED after PUZZLE 2)

Frankly, I'm not expecting any of you to actually be able to operate me with any sort of skill, but I suppose I can at least let you decide what direction to travel in.

To go back in time, turn to page 16.
To go forward in time, turn to page 17.

(added after Puzzle 3a and Puzzle 3b, using a stamp/sticker)

If you're bored of time traveling, turn to page 34.

Your petty attempts at trickery won't work on me. Begone, cheater! Our partnership is over. That goes for all of you! Don't just try to hand me off to one of your meddling friends.

Farewell, team, and may you be cursed with a thousand overdue fines!

\begin{center}
  THE END

Aha! Good. Now that you've proven yourself worthy, proceed to Location ⬟ and await further instructions.

(at Location ⬟, they are checked in and directed to Appendix Q, section X

(once puzzle is solved, the page is replaced with:)

PUZZLE ONE
BOOKSWEEPER (maybe? Not sure what it should be)

Whoops, dead end! You already solved this one. Back to page 1 with you!

--- Page 6

Oops -- sorry -- guess that wasn't right. Pardon the pun, and the towering inferno that is about to engulf you -- really, quite sorry about that --

The important thing is not to panic! Just hold your breath, think non-flammable thoughts, and turn to page 18.

(replaced with same page as before)

--- Page 7

Now that all of that is settled, it's time to move on. Let's never speak of it again.

To distract ourselves from whatever it was that just occured, let's count all of the elements that don't end with ``UM'' and proceed to that page, shall we?

--- Page 8

I suppose it’s time to explain everything. You see, I am in fact an embodiment of all of the books you failed to read carefully enough during your high school English classes, and I have risen from the dead in order to subject you and your friends here to an endless cycle of torment and confusion. Puzzles with no answers, papercuts on every finger… all this and more awaits you in my land of eternal doom.

Bow down, mortal! Or you shall never see the light of day again!

\begin{center}
To protest, turn to page 9.

To resign yourself to your fate, turn to page 10.
\end{center}

--- Page 9

You all fall off a cliff and perish instantly. Sorry! I really tried to prevent it, but I am just a book! Nothing could be done. I’ll do my best to ensure that the proper authorities are notified.

\begin{center}
  THE END
\end{center}

--- Page 10

You seem to be going in circles. That’s not a very productive way to get around.

To go forwards, turn to page 10.

To go backwards, turn to page 10.

--- Page 11

Apparently I can trust you after all! Excellent. You know, I had a good feeling about this team.

I suppose it’s time to explain everything. Go to the next page.

(when solved, replaced with same thing)

--- Page 12

Go to Location X. I’ll show you what this is all about.

(when solved, replace with:)

PUZZLE TWO
ANOTHER TIME

So? Now do you understand it? The librarians have been altering history! Changing -- or should I say demolishing -- classic books to better attract the youths of today! It must be stopped.

If you’re with me, return to page 1.
If you’re against me, go to page 29.

--- Page 13

The scaly beast appears pleased by your attempts at entertainment. He begins to nod his head to the beat of your improvised tune, until eventually he has nodded off entirely. As he snores, great plumes of smoke shoot from his nostrils.

To back away slowly and save yourselves, turn to page 6.
To grab as much of the gold as you can fit in your pockets, go to the next page.

--- Page 14

Great. You made the dragon angry. Nice going, team. Real smooth.

Well, at least it doesn’t seem too -- oh wait -- hang on -- oh no that’s not good. Yikes. That’s very not good. I mean maybe it’s just --

EVERYBODY DUCK! Okay, okay, stay calm! Turn to page 18, now!

Well, aren’t you hard to impress? I suppose you meet a sentient, magical book every day, do you?

Turn to page 25.

--- Page 25

Hate to admit it, but you kind of stand out around here. All of you. I mean, the pencils alone make you look like some sort of historical reenactment troupe.

It’s probably best if you find someplace without a lot of curious bystanders before. Preferably soon. That android with the glowy saw thing keeps glancing this way.

Try Location \%\%?

(once solved, replaced with)

PUZZLE 3B
PREDICTIONS

Well, that’s all well and good, but we still haven’t managed to learn anything useful. Let’s go back to the present for now. Turn to page 3.

Quick! Go to Location \&\&, before they notice that you’re onto them!
