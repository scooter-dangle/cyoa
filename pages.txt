I suppose it's time to explain everything. You see, I am in fact an embodiment of all of the books you failed to read carefully enough during your high school English classes, and I have risen from the dead in order to subject you and your friends here to an endless cycle of torment and confusion. Puzzles with no answers, papercuts on every finger... all this and more awaits you in my land of eternal doom.

At this point you may be thinking, ``Hang on, a moment ago we were facing certain death but now we're apparently not dead and the source of our impending doom has seemingly vanished.''

First of all, you're welcome. Second of all, I promise it will all make sense eventually.

Really? Ouch. To be honest, I wasn't expecting you to choose that. I guess I overestimated you lot. As it turns out, you're stuck with me now (and likewise), so I guess we'll just have to work past this sudden betrayal and try to learn to trust each other once more.
